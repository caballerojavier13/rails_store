This is an e-commerce application that was designed to learn Ruby on Rails.

The application can be run by pointing your termninal to the directory of the application, and running the command 'rails s'.

The application was developed with Ruby 2.0.0p451, and Rails 4.1.1.

In this application users are able:

- Browse and shop for paintings. There is a subset of the product catalogue displayed on the main page, and users are able to browse using product categories, or by using the search bar.

- Add products to their shopping cart. At the moment, the field for updating the quantity of the product the customer wants to purchase is still under development.

- Complete the transaction by going through the checkout form.

- There is an implemented mailer that sends a notification email to the customer after the transaction is complete, and displays the products they purchased. This would also serve as their receipt.

Website administrators are able:

- Log in to manage the website. Website designed so that it could be managed by a non technical individual. In the login page, the 'forgot password' and 'remember me' functions are still being developed. 

- Navigate to orders section where they can view the orders that were submitted, edit customer info, notify customers by email that their order was shipped, and delete orders. The notification of shipment feature is still under development.

- Manage the product catalogue, by editing current product listings, removing products, or adding new products to the store.

- Create new administrator accounts.

As mentioned earlier, this project was taken on to learn more about Ruby on Rails, I plan to update it with features, or improvements as much my school schedule will permit.
